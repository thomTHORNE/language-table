1. Bug: Missing sorting functionality and probable conflict with column collapse functionality.
Expectation: Change so that the collapse and sorting only works when clicking on respective icons (make it user-friendly so that the click area is a bit larger than the icon itself).

2. Bug: When user clicks outside the cell that is currently in edit mode, the cell correctly assumes display mode, but clicking any cell afterwards will not enter edit mode. 
Expectation: Clicking away from the cell currently in edit mode should switch that cell into display mode and allow user to enter into edit mode for any other cell afterwards.
